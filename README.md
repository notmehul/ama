I thought it would be fun having an AMA repo, so...

[![Ask Me Anything !](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ask%20me-anything-1abc9c.svg)](https://GitHub.com/notmehul/ama)

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Life. Code. TV Shows. 
Gaming. Movies. Whatever. :joy:

### :memo: Guidelines

 - :mag: Ensure your question has not already been answered.
 - :memo: Use a succinct title and description.
 - :blush: Be nice, civil and polite ([as always](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/)).
 - :heart_eyes: If you include at least one emoji in your question, the feedback might come faster!
